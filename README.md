1. Image processing with keras in python
The journey into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been truly captivating! 
CNNs are the backbone of modern image processing and computer vision, and this course has provided a deep dive into this exciting world. 
I now have the skills to design, train, and deploy CNNs for image recognition and processing,
and I can't wait to apply this knowledge to real-world projects.
